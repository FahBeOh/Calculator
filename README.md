## Summary
Building a calculator is a good exercise in honing your javascript skills. This calculator is a step into the world of modular JS. The object literal pattern lends itself to many benefits such as..

* Good code organization
* Self containment (per module)
* Avoiding global scope pollution
* Promotion of seperation of concerns

Gaining a solid foundation in modularization is the first step in the move from thinking like a coder, to thinking like a software developer. My hope is that this gives you a simple and clear example of the javacript object literal design pattern.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (ES5/ES6)
